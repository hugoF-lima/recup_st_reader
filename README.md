# recup_st_reader
Another automation Tool using somewhat similar mechanisms to my the local_xml_reader project, with the difference this time around being the use of a .json file (originally converted from a .csv file) for accomodating the invoice records.

Such as the local_xml_Reader, this application required (merely by an in-code window check) an external application to run. But that's relatively easy to overcome if you wish to assign to a new software. (However, new b64 strings for img elements would be necessary, along with figuring out the coordinates. This whole project serves as an example of getting to such end).
